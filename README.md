1st commit This is just a LecturerWindow, its the part of the prototype that has buttons to allow for submission and entering hours and uploading documents due to part 1 asking for front end only, theres no functionality yet.

Upload doc button will allow for uploading documents Submit button submits claims from lecturers

My Claims It will contain all the claims the lecturer submitted and the claims will have a status shown of pending, approved by coordinator, rejected by coordinator, approved by manager and rejected by manager with the date it was submited, the claim ID, Amount, hours and date it was submitted.

2nd commit Roles Window Allows for the the user to choose between lecturer and coordinator. If lecturer is picked the lecturer window opens, if coordinator is picked the coordinator window opens. its not buttons its more or circles to pick from. It already has a colour skeem which is blue.

Coordinator Window The coordinator window was added, It allows for coordinators to review the claims and reject or approve the claims. It displays the ClaimID, amount, hours and the status of the claim. The close button allows for the window to close and show the roles window again.

Lecturer Window changes Lecturer window allows for the user to press close to go back and press coordinator.

3rd commit
Add Manager Window, Very similar to the coordinator window instead approved and rejected claims from coordinator gets sent to the manager, so claims only show after it was approved or rejected, cant see because not have been approved or rejected yet as an example. The the close button closes the window and leads the user back to the role window.

Roles Window was updated, it now contains the method which allows when manager is clicked on it opens the manager window
